                        <p style="font-size: small;">We were recently tasked with an Alternative Assessment to develop a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                            This project was challenging but also incredibly exciting, as it allowed us to learn and explore the world of web development.

                            We have extensively used CSS to style this beautiful website. We have made use of both inline and external CSS. 
                            We have mainly used class selectors and styled each element that you are able to see.
                            Various attributes such as background-image, margin, padding, font-color, font-family, text-align, hover and many more.

                    <div>
                        <h2>HTML</h2>
                        <p>The weather card that you are able to see is designed using html. Various tags such as div, p, button are used to design it. 
                            Also the navbar and the table is the product of html.

                        <h2>Javascript</h2>
                        <p>This website mainly works on Javascript. We have used the openweathermap API that is used to return the values like temperature, 
                            humidity, windspeed etc. of a particular city that we want. We have also used image discovery platform called as Unsplash that 
                            is used to insert the images in the background based on the city.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>CSS</h2>
                        <p>Everything that you see is made using HTML and finally it is styled using CSS. We have used various styling properties to make the elements look 
                            better. We have used Bootstrap to design the navbar and this about page itself. This is known as stacking cards.
